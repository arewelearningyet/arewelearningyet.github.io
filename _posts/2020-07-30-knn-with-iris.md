## Guess what kind of flower we're looking at!

#### This exploration is based on the classic Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper ["The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems"](http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/coll/special//fisher/138.pdf) as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
