### What areas have experienced greatest casualties due to armed conflict?
## This exploration relies particularly on the UCDP's Geo-referenced Event Dataset

This dataset includes longitude and latitude coordinates for conflicts resulting in as few as a single casualty.
Mapped by these coordinates, with marker size representing the relative number of casualties (taken from lowest estimated figures) it is clear that **both frequency and magnitude of high-casualty conflicts are concentrated in Africa and South West Asia/Middle East**.

In exploring the category of civilian death specifically, very little definition was revealed due to an extreme outlier: the genocide in Rwanda, which dwarfs the death toll of all other armed conflicts during this time frame in terms of civilian casualties, estimated in this dataset at over half a million civilians dead in 1994 alone. (This number is lower than estimates [by the UN](https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/historical-background.shtml) and conservative by most other sources.)

In order to demonstrate more detail in other regions during this time period, I returned to the variables available to see if there were other angles to observe that would minimize the skewing by this outlying event, and used scatterplotting on the variable above, deaths of civilians, and compared it with the best, lowest, and highest estimated total casualties grouped by country and summed up per year:


![high, best, civilian estimates](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_low_differentiation_scatter.png?raw=true)![low estimate](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_differentiation_scatter_low.png?raw=true)

This set of scatterplots reveals that, in terms of deaths of civilians, the genocide in Rwanda was the most distinct event by far regardless of country or year; the **least skewed angle would be to examine total deaths per country per year by the _lowest estimates available_.**
