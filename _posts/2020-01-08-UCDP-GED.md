### What areas have experienced greatest casualties due to armed conflict?
## This exploration relies particularly on the UCDP's Geo-referenced Event Dataset

This dataset includes longitude and latitude coordinates for conflicts resulting as few as one casualty.
Mapped by these coordinates, with marker size representing the relative number of casualties (taken from lowest estimated figures) it is clear that both frequency and magnitude of high-casualty conflicts are concentrated in Africa and South West Asia/Middle East.

In exploring the category of civilian death specifically, there was very little definition revealed due to an extreme outlier: the genocide in Rwanda, which dwarfs the death toll of all other armed conflicts during this time frame in terms of civilian casualties, with an estimate of over half a million civilians dead in 1994 alone. (This number is lower than estimates [by the UN](https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/historical-background.shtml) and some other sources.)

To find more information on casualties of armed conflict in this time period, I returned to the variables available to see if there were other angles to look that would minimize the skewing by this outlying event, and
