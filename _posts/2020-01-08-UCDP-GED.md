## Where have greatest casualties occurred due to armed conflict?
### [This exploration draws from the UCDP's Geo-referenced Event Dataset (version 19.1)](https://ucdp.uu.se/exploratory)



This dataset includes longitude and latitude coordinates for conflicts resulting in as few as a single casualty.
Mapped by these coordinates, with marker size representing the relative number of casualties (taken from lowest estimated figures) it is clear that **both frequency and magnitude of high-casualty conflicts are concentrated in Africa and South West Asia/Middle East**.

In exploring the category of civilian death specifically, **very little definition was revealed due to an extreme outlier: the genocide in Rwanda,** which dwarfs the death toll of all other armed conflicts during this time frame in terms of civilian casualties, estimated in this dataset at over half a million civilians dead in 1994 alone. (This number is lower than estimates [by the UN](https://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/historical-background.shtml) and conservative by most other sources.)

<br><br>
In order to demonstrate more detail in other regions during this time period, I returned to the variables available to see if there were other angles to observe that would minimize the skewing by this outlying event. Using scatterplotting to compare civilian deaths with the best, lowest, and highest **estimated total casualties** grouped by country and summed up per year...

[![high, best, civilian estimates](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_low_differentiation_scatter.png?raw=true)![low estimate](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_differentiation_scatter_low.png?raw=true)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EvIwlftRAd3tB0s3Es6WNboqZM4skZiq#scrollTo=2FKpPSdsRaUr&line=3&uniqifier=1)

...this set of scatterplots reveals that, **in terms of _'deaths of civilians'_,** the genocide in Rwanda was the most distinct event by far regardless of country or year; the **least skewed angle would be to examine total deaths per country per year by the _lowest estimates available_.**

In applying the same visualization to this factor, we can find a lot more information on the cumulative casualties in other countries during this timeframe, with **Afghanistan having a greater cumulative total of casualties** during the same time period, by the lowest estimates.

<br><br>

In interest of further defining the ways that different regions have experienced loss of life due to armed conflict **_over time,_** I derived figures for the cumulative totals as each year passed during this timeframe, based on lowest estimates, and **represented the accruing losses each year** by the size of the markers for each country on a global map.

## Other revelations...

Of some note, another factor in this dataset in terms of casualties was 'deaths_unknown,' where the casualties were known, but **whether they could be identified as being party to 'side_a', 'side_b', or civilian was _unknown_;** this factor was substantially higher in 2001 and 2000 than any other year, which led to the question of **whether this was a geographically-specific phenomenon**.<br>

[![of note, total unknown deaths per year](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_deaths_unknown.png?raw=true)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EvIwlftRAd3tB0s3Es6WNboqZM4skZiq#scrollTo=IF5aFxBNfiWE&line=2&uniqifier=1)

In running visualisations of this variable by country, it is observable that **Ethiopia substantially contributes** to this spike at this time:
[![global deaths unknown 1989-2018](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_deaths_unknown_global.png?raw=true)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EvIwlftRAd3tB0s3Es6WNboqZM4skZiq#scrollTo=Db3NyJl9Cf68&line=4&uniqifier=1)

Wanting to know more about significant peaks in this factor by country over years, I sorted the countries by the **highest _total unknown deaths_**, and graphed total unknown deaths **_per year, per leading countries_.**

[![countries with most casualties unidentified](https://github.com/arewelearningyet/arewelearningyet.github.io/blob/master/img/UCDP_deaths_unknown_sort.png?raw=true)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EvIwlftRAd3tB0s3Es6WNboqZM4skZiq#scrollTo=2eyuaD3fDqsU)

These trends can largely be understood in terms of major events known to have occurred in these regions, such as [the Eritrean-Ethiopian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eritrean%E2%80%93Ethiopian_War#Casualties,_displacement_and_economic_disruption).

   This factor, along with deaths of civilians, is of significant concern. While it is generally agreed that civilian deaths are particularly unsavory in terms of armed conflict, being unable to identify what party - if any - a particular casualty belongs to erases either their innocence as a civilian, or their conviction as a party to the conflict, in either case adding a significant conceptual or symbolic disregard to the already-tragic loss of life, and potentially contributing to the power of conflicting parties to spin these losses in whichever ways may benefit their narrative and justifications for enacting past and future violence.
